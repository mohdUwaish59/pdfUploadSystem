# pdfUploadSystem
This system is developed as a part of the project work to develop a Plagiarism Detection System and this will be integrated into TEIMMA app later.

# About this system
The sysem has a home page with two buttons named 'Annotator' and 'Plagiarism'. While 'plagiarism' button works and lands us on the source document and candidate document upload page, working of 'annotator' button is yet to be implemneted.

On Upload page, user can separately upload source document and candidate documents which are stored separately.
